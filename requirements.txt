Certainly! Below are the MongoDB collections represented in a tabular form:

#### User Collection:

| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \_id             | ObjectId     | Unique identifier for users                      |
| username         | String       | User's username                                  |
| password         | String       | User's hashed password                           |
| profilePicture   | String       | URL/path to profile picture                      |
| status           | String       | Online/Offline status                            |

| bio              | String       | User's bio/description                          |
| groups           | [ObjectId]   | Array of group IDs the user belongs to           |

#### Group Collection:

| Field            | Type         | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \_id             | ObjectId     | Unique identifier for groups                     |
| name             | String       | Name of the group                                |
| members          | [ObjectId]   | Array of user IDs who are members of the group   |

#### Message Collection:

| Field            | Type         | Description                                      |
| ---------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| \_id             | ObjectId     | Unique identifier for messages                   |
| sender           | ObjectId     | User ID of the sender                            |
| receiver         | ObjectId     | User ID of the receiver                          |
| group            | ObjectId     | Group ID (if the message is part of a group)     |
| content          | String       | Text content of the message                      |
| timestamp        | ISODate      | Timestamp of when the message was sent           |
| readReceipts     | [{user, timestamp}] | Array of read receipts, each containing the user ID and timestamp when the message was read |

Please note that this tabular representation simplifies the structure for better visualization. In MongoDB, the values in the `groups`, `members`, `sender`, `receiver`, and `group` fields are represented as ObjectId types, linking documents between collections. The actual data would be stored in BSON (Binary JSON) format.

Ensure that you index the fields appropriately based on your application's query patterns to optimize performance.
